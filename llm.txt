This project uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance its functionality. The integration of LLMs helps in:

1. Natural language processing for command interpretation
2. Automated code analysis and suggestions
3. Intelligent error handling and debugging assistance
4. Dynamic response generation based on market conditions

The LLM components are designed to be modular and can be easily extended or modified based on specific requirements. The implementation ensures responsible AI usage while maintaining the security and reliability of the trading system.
